  - Why does minimax look worse than rmse for rat-05 with 64 params?
    - probably because minimax is dumb when run per-channel?

Key research questions

  - compare this approach to 

    - just fit a non-rational polymial with same # of coeff
      (is rational function always better?)

    - rational least-squares fitting (like fit_viridis_leastsq)
      without QP (probably see lots of roots in denominator)

    - just QP without subsequent least squares 

    - scipy's "global optimizers"


  - try RANSAC

Other things to try:

  - relax from L2 to inf norm when moving to minimax?
  - greedily increase denominator degree one at a time?
  - what least_squares method ('tr', 'lm', 'dogbox') is best?
  - what minimize method is best ('Nelder-Mead', 'BFGS', etc.)?
  - do optimization across multiple channels?
